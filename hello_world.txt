One giant leap for mankind.
After getting up at 3am...
After a tough lower body workout...
And after all this Coding with Odin today...
a nap sounds real good right about now.

Now it's Sunday and I'm working on TOP before food prep for the week
And adding this to test out the git commit VScode message feature.
